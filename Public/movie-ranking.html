    <h3>Pride and Prejudice</h3>
    <p>Since its immediate success in 1813, Pride and Prejudice has remained one of the most popular novels in the English language. Jane Austen called this brilliant work "her own darling child" and its vivacious heroine, Elizabeth Bennet, "as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print." The romantic clash between the opinionated Elizabeth and her proud beau, Mr. Darcy, is a splendid performance of civilized sparring. And Jane Austen's radiant wit sparkles as her characters dance a delicate quadrille of flirtation and intrigue, making this book the most superb comedy of manners of Regency England.</p>
    <h3>Titanic</h3>
    <p>Jack, a young artist, wins a card game to travel to America on the Titanic, the largest and safest ocean liner ever built. On board he meets Rose (Kate Winslet), a down-and-out young woman from a good family who is to enter into a marriage of convenience with Cal (Billy Zane), a self-important millionaire who is only interested in his fiancée's prestigious family name. Jack and Rose fall in love, but her fiancé and her mother put all kinds of obstacles to their relationship. Meanwhile, the gigantic luxury liner is approaching an immense iceberg.</p>
    <h3>The Godfather</h3>
    <p>The Godfather is a 1972 American epic gangster film directed by Francis Ford Coppola, who co-wrote the screenplay with Mario Puzo, based on Puzo's best-selling 1969 novel of the same title. The film stars an ensemble cast including Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Richard Castellano, Robert Duvall, Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard Conte, and Diane Keaton. It is the first installment in The Godfather trilogy, chronicling the Corleone family under patriarch Vito Corleone (Brando) from 1945 to 1955. It focuses on the transformation of his youngest son, Michael Corleone (Pacino), from reluctant family outsider to ruthless mafia boss.</p>
